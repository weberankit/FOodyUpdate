# FOody
<h1>A Taste of ReactJS: âœ´A Food-Web App Powered by Tailwind and Reactâœ´ </h1>
<b>update</b>
Location-Wise Rendering of Restaurant Lists (State-Wise):
<h2>
ğŸš€ I have enabled the app to render restaurant lists based on the user's location.
ğŸš€ Users can simply click the nearby button, and the app will display restaurants in their current city.
Fallback to Default List (Delhi) When Location Denied:
</h2>
<h2>
ğŸŒˆ If a user denies access to their location, your app gracefully falls back to displaying a default list of restaurants in Delhi.
Alert for Unavailable Swiggy-Attached Restaurants:
</h2>
<h2>
ğŸŒˆ If a user's location doesn't have Swiggy-attached restaurants available or if the user denies access, your app provides an alert message.
This ensures that users are aware of the limitation and can still access a default list.
Cross-Platform Compatibility (Phone):
</h2>
<h2>
ğŸŒˆ You've resolved API issues to make the location-based rendering feature work seamlessly on mobile devices.
This enhances the accessibility of your app, making it user-friendly across different platforms.
</h2>
